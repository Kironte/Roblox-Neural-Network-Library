Hello! I am [Kironte](https://devforum.roblox.com/u/kironte/summary) and this is the Roblox Neural Network Library, the second iteration of my NN library work. Here you will find thorough explanations on machine learning, the module, it's documentation, and example code that will set you up for your machine learning programming.<br><br>
For a proper (and lengthy) **introduction** to machine learning and the library, head [here](intro).<br><br>
For a short explanation on how to **install** the library, check out [this page](install).<br><br>
For some **example code** that shows what basic scripts that use this library should look like, [go here](exampleCode).<br><br>
For the full **API documentation** of every class in the library (it is lengthy), check out this [section](documentation/NeuralNetwork).<br><br>
That is about it! I hope you enjoy this library and make some cool creations. If you do, make sure to let me know on the Devforum article and I might add a new section that would contain all of them. I am not very experienced in ML training and don't have much time or need to create anything cool out of the library, but I'm sure there are people out there that have way too much time on their hands.
