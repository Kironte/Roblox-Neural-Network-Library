# **NodeLayer Class**
This class is responsible for housing several nodes into 1 tangible layer. Probably should've been a simple array but I thought I will need some functions here eventually.

<div class=functionDoc>
NodeLayer .new()
Creates and returns the NodeLayer.
</div>

<div class=functionDoc>
void :AddNodes(Tuple ...)
Adds the given tuple of nodes into the layer.
</div>

<div class=functionDoc>
array :GetNodes()
Returns the array of nodes in the layer.
</div>
